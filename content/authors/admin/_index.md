## About Me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo. I recently obtained my PhD in Solid Earth Geophysics from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and my primary research interests include volcano seismic and acoustic tremor, high-resolution earthquake catalogs, and multidisciplinary volcano monitoring and conceptual models. My research is funded by the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent (START) Scheme, which is co-funded by the Ministry of Education and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
